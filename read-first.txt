This is first time creating something in nestjs

first thing: 
  npm i -g @nestjs/cli@latest
  nest new nestjs-api

In NestJS APP
    Get Request => Controller => Service

To generate a new module for our application using cli@latest
  "nest generate module pokemon"
  "nest g service pokemon"
  "nest g controller pokemon"
              or
  "nest g resource pokemon" -> creates module, controller and service + extra files
